## About The Project
* Qustions which are covered with SQL:
  - Assume any database includes below columns and you are requested to process Stats_Access_Link column and extract pure url information inside per device type.
    - Rules:
      - Xml tags and protocol parts is guaranteed to be lower case
      - Access link part that we are interested in can have alpha-numeric, case insensitive characters, underscore ( _ ) character and dot ( . ) character only.

* Qustions which are covered with Python:
  - Implement code to fill the missing data (impute) in daily_vaccinations column per country with the minimum daily vaccination number of relevant countries. Note: If a country does not have any valid vaccination number yet, fill it with “0” (zero).
  - Implement code to list the top-3 countries with highest median daily vaccination numbers by considering missing values imputed version of dataset.
  - What is the number of total vaccinations done on 1/6/2021 (MM/DD/YYYY) by considering missing values imputed version of dataset?
  - If this list would be a database table, please provide SQL query to fill in the missing daily vaccination numbers with discrete median of country. his time SQL equivalent is requested, and imputation value is median of each country, not minimum. Please remember filling countries with zero if they do not have any valid daily_vaccination records like Kuwait.
